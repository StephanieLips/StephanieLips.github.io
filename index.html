          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Yes, I eat meat. Yes, I like it. Yes, I eat it without thinking about it.
              And that was the problem. I didn't think about what I put into my body. So
              I planned to eat only vegetarian food for a whole month. Besides that, I've
              read that you can create a habit after 30 days of doing something. So let's try.</p>
            <p>I started out harder than I thought. I'm used to put meat in my meals without
              even recognizing it. Every time I made myself pasta or a salad, I put ham cubes
              in it. Since it was so common for me, it was especially hard to quit meat completely.
              But I started on Sunday - 02.09.2018 - and failed on the third day. Most of the time
              I take something to eat with me to work. On the fail-day, I wanted to have some
              vegetarian dumplings. So I got them and packed a little salad with vegetarian
              German ravioli and - without thinking about it - swizz meat salad (meat with cheese).
              When me and my collegues were back at work and starting to have lunch together
              I recognized that now there was meat in my lunch. I really hate throwing food away.
              That's why I ate it.</p>
              <p>From that lunch on I managed to stay a vegetarian. It helps a lot to write a plan
              of what I will eat the next few days. There are some rules I made for myself you could
              judge me for. I'll still eat candy with gelatin and I'll still eat fish. That technically
              makes me a pescetarian. I want to try to eat as less as I can do of both.</p>
              <p>I'm nearly done with my first week of being vegetarian. So far so failed. But I only
                can do better. I'll keep you posted.</p>
