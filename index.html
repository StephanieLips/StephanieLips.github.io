          <h3 class="post-title">New hobbies</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>There was a time last month I was really bored. There was a lot to do because
              I just moved in with my boyfriend. But since he was on summer vacation he did
              most of the stuff while I was at work. And at work - well there wasn't a lot
              to do either. I don't like sitting around and spending my time doing nothing.
              That's when I started to look closely what I like to do and what I like to read
              about.</p>
            <p>First of all I decided that English shouldn't be my only second language. So I
              chose Spanish to be the language I want to learn. Since I use an app to learn
              phrases and vocabulary it's pretty easy to use it on my commute. Since my travel
              to Barcelona last year I'm eager to learn Spanish because I find it a strong and
              beautiful language. I've had Latin in school which makes the learning process much
              simpler. Living in Europe with so many nice languages around, I might try to learn
              a new language (probably French, Danish or maybe even Russian).</p>
            <p>The second hobby I picked up again is sports. I started a 30-days-training so I
              have a little training because I haven't had a lot of spirit to go to the gym.
              Besides that I wanted to go running again so I convinced my boyfriend to go with me
              (I have asthma and I'm a little scared of breathing problems). It goes pretty well
              which makes me extremely happy. And we picked up a goal of running a half-marathon
              next year.</p>
            <p>Those two are not the only hobbies I started doing (again) but those I want to
              mention. I'll keep you posted how the increase of sports adds up with my veggie
              way of life. Gracias por su atenci√≥n.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">One month vegetarian</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Yes, I eat meat. Yes, I like it. Yes, I eat it without thinking about it.
              And that was the problem. I didn't think about what I put into my body. So
              I planned to eat only vegetarian food for a whole month. Besides that, I've
              read that you can create a habit after 30 days of doing something. So let's try.</p>
            <p>I started out harder than I thought. I'm used to put meat in my meals without
              even recognizing it. Every time I made myself pasta or a salad, I put ham cubes
              in it. Since it was so common for me, it was especially hard to quit meat completely.
              But I started on Sunday - 02.09.2018 - and failed on the third day. Most of the time
              I take something to eat with me to work. On the fail-day, I wanted to have some
              vegetarian dumplings. So I got them and packed a little salad with vegetarian
              German ravioli and - without thinking about it - swizz meat salad (meat with cheese).
              When me and my collegues were back at work and starting to have lunch together
              I recognized that now there was meat in my lunch. I really hate throwing food away.
              That's why I ate it.</p>
              <p>From that lunch on I managed to stay a vegetarian. It helps a lot to write a plan
              of what I will eat the next few days. There are some rules I made for myself you could
              judge me for. I'll still eat candy with gelatin and I'll still eat fish. That technically
              makes me a pescetarian. I want to try to eat as less as I can do of both.</p>
              <p>I'm nearly done with my first week of being vegetarian. So far so failed. But I only
                can do better. I'll keep you posted.</p>
