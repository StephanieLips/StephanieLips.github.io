                  <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Well - hello I guess. Maybe some of you recognized that I was gone for
                        a little while. And I was. But it had very good reasons. In the last
                        post I talked about bore-out. And I had one. So after I realized that I'm
                        not happy in my job, not happy in my relationship and not happy in general
                        after all, I decided to take a break and get my life back together (draaama).</p>
                    <p>So like I just said I got my life back together. I broke up with my bf because
                        we're happier without each other. I let my job kick me out (if you get fired you
                        can get money from the unemployment agency) and I applied for jobs all over the
                        country. Sounds drastic but it was the best I could do. My november and december
                        was filled with looking for jobs, saying goodbye to my friends, interviews and
                        packing up my apartment.</p>
                    <p>Where did I end up? In DÃ¼sseldorf. It's the capital city of the federal state of
                        North Rhine-Westphalia. I've never been there before but I fell in love with it
                        the moment I finally moved here and had the time to get to know the city.
                        My new job? I'm still a project manager but now I'm planning everything around
                        pharmacies. It's lovely and I finally get up and go to work every day with a smile
                        on my face. New partner? We'll see.</p>
                    <p>One of my new years resolutions was to build up this blog again and now I've got the time
                        for doing it. Expect a new blog post every week! Stay strong, stay positive and stay interested.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Why bore-out is a thing</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
          <p>All of the time people wonder how I can cope with stress that well. I love stress
              and I love having a shitload of work to do. It's just how I am. And when you take
              the stress away from me I get bored quite easily. I have never had not much to
              nothing to do. But now it's the case and here is what this is doing to me:</p>
            <p>1. It's stressing me out. But wait... didn't I just say that I don't have anything
              to do. Yes I did. But it's still stressful. You know that you have to be at work for
              40 hours. You know that you have to do something at least. You know that you can't
              just book the next flight to somewhere or look into the best restaurants around you.
              You know that you sit there and just stare at the display trying to figure out which
              pages aren't suspicious to look at. And when other people walk by my work space I want
              to look like I have something to do and I'm busy.</p>
            <p>2. It's making me depressed. Having to deal with depression anyways it's even harder
              to have a job which doesn't fulfill you. I always think about a thousand things which
              I could accomplish in that moment. It makes me feel worthless in that sense that I
              can't contribute anything to my company, my customer's satisfaction or even to myself.
              It is even proven that such a thing as a boreout is a medical condition as well as a
              burnout. And it makes you sick and even depressed (like I figured myself).</p>
            <p>3. Beside of the physical and psychological effects on you it's even harder to
              explain this to your friends. All of them do have a lot or at least enough to do at work
              which makes them say things like "wow, be glad you have some free time" or "Don't
              complain. Could be worse". Of course they don't mean to harm you or belittle you in
              any way but it makes you doubt the gravity of your problem.</p>
            <p>Summary: Please do not underestimate the power of boredom. It harms you in a lot more
              ways than you might think. I really have to reflect my way of living and working. I'll
              keep you posted what's going on and how I'll solve this.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Two weeks update</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Now - two weeks in I wanted to give a review on what went well and what
              didn't. First of all I'm really happy that my friends and family got along
              with it very well.</p>
            <p>I might just start with the downsides of being vegetarian. There are only
              two things I really recognized though. First of all some people react weird
              to me saying that I want to try a vegetarian lifestyle before fully adopting
              it. Yes, I get that it sounds weird but since changes are never easy and I
              actually liked the taste of meat I want to try it first. Secondly, I found
              it hard while eating out to spot the vegetarian dishes. I eat nearly everything
              so it shouldn't be hard, right? Wrong. But mostly a salad is vegetarian and most
              of the restaurants have salads. Helps me losing weight as well I guess.</p>
            <p>Since there are always two sides to a matter, I want to talk about the good
              parts of vegetarianism as well. To get directly to the point: I feel great.
              I always struggled with an iron deficiency and I have the feeling that it's a
              problem that came back again. But there's not much you can't cure with some
              pills. Besides that I feel fitter and willing to do something and move my ass.
              My digestive system finally works a lot better (I'm not going into detail there).
              I pointed out in my downsides that some restaurants don't have a lot of vegetarian
              options. But I have to say that that's a good thing as well since I'm not that
              good in deciding what I want to eat.</p>
            <p>I'm now really excited to continue this "experiment" and tell you after a month
              (or more) how I feel and what changed. Oh by the way... I didn't even eat fish last
              week. So I got that going for me which is nice.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">New hobbies</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>There was a time last month I was really bored. There was a lot to do because
              I just moved in with my boyfriend. But since he was on summer vacation he did
              most of the stuff while I was at work. And at work - well there wasn't a lot
              to do either. I don't like sitting around and spending my time doing nothing.
              That's when I started to look closely what I like to do and what I like to read
              about.</p>
            <p>First of all I decided that English shouldn't be my only second language. So I
              chose Spanish to be the language I want to learn. Since I use an app to learn
              phrases and vocabulary it's pretty easy to use it on my commute. Since my travel
              to Barcelona last year I'm eager to learn Spanish because I find it a strong and
              beautiful language. I've had Latin in school which makes the learning process much
              simpler. Living in Europe with so many nice languages around, I might try to learn
              a new language (probably French, Danish or maybe even Russian).</p>
            <p>The second hobby I picked up again is sports. I started a 30-days-training so I
              have a little training because I haven't had a lot of spirit to go to the gym.
              Besides that I wanted to go running again so I convinced my boyfriend to go with me
              (I have asthma and I'm a little scared of breathing problems). It goes pretty well
              which makes me extremely happy. And we picked up a goal of running a half-marathon
              next year.</p>
            <p>Those two are not the only hobbies I started doing (again) but those I want to
              mention. I'll keep you posted how the increase of sports adds up with my veggie
              way of life. Gracias por su atenciÃ³n.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">One month vegetarian</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Yes, I eat meat. Yes, I like it. Yes, I eat it without thinking about it.
              And that was the problem. I didn't think about what I put into my body. So
              I planned to eat only vegetarian food for a whole month. Besides that, I've
              read that you can create a habit after 30 days of doing something. So let's try.</p>
            <p>I started out harder than I thought. I'm used to put meat in my meals without
              even recognizing it. Every time I made myself pasta or a salad, I put ham cubes
              in it. Since it was so common for me, it was especially hard to quit meat completely.
              But I started on Sunday - 02.09.2018 - and failed on the third day. Most of the time
              I take something to eat with me to work. On the fail-day, I wanted to have some
              vegetarian dumplings. So I got them and packed a little salad with vegetarian
              German ravioli and - without thinking about it - swizz meat salad (meat with cheese).
              When me and my collegues were back at work and starting to have lunch together
              I recognized that now there was meat in my lunch. I really hate throwing food away.
              That's why I ate it.</p>
              <p>From that lunch on I managed to stay a vegetarian. It helps a lot to write a plan
              of what I will eat the next few days. There are some rules I made for myself you could
              judge me for. I'll still eat candy with gelatin and I'll still eat fish. That technically
              makes me a pescetarian. I want to try to eat as less as I can do of both.</p>
              <p>I'm nearly done with my first week of being vegetarian. So far so failed. But I only
                can do better. I'll keep you posted.</p>
